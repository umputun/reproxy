[![build](https://github.com/umputun/reproxy/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/umputun/reproxy/actions/workflows/ci.yml)&nbsp;[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/umputun/reproxy/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/umputun/reproxy?branch=master)&nbsp;[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/umputun/reproxy)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/umputun/reproxy)&nbsp;[![Docker Automated build](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/jrottenberg/ffmpeg.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/umputun/reproxy)

Server (host) can be set as FQDN, i.e. `s.example.com` or `*` (catch all). Requested url can be regex, for example `^/api/(.*)` and destination url may have regex matched groups in, i.e. `http://d.example.com:8080/$1`. For the example above `http://s.example.com/api/something?foo=bar` will be proxied to `http://d.example.com:8080/something?foo=bar`.

For convenience, requests with the trailing `/` and without regex groups expanded to `/(.*)`, and destinations in those cases expanded to `/$1`. I.e. `/api/` -> `http://127.0.0.1/service` will be translated to `^/api/(.*)` -> `http://127.0.0.1/service/$1`

Both HTTP and HTTPS supported. For HTTPS, static certificate can be used as well as automated ACME (Let's Encrypt) certificates. Optional assets server can be used to serve static files. Starting reproxy requires at least one provider defined. The rest of parameters are strictly optional and have sane default.

Examples:
 - with a static provider: `reproxy --static.enabled --static.rule="example.com/api/(.*),https://api.example.com/$1"`
 - with an automatic docker discovery: `reproxy --docker.enabled --docker.auto`

## Install

Reproxy distributed as a small self-contained binary as well as a docker image. Both binary and image support multiple architectures and multiple operating systems, including linux_x86_64, linux_arm64, linux_arm, macos_x86_64, macos_arm64, windows_x86_64 and windows_arm. We also provide both arm64 and x86 deb and rpm packages.

- for a binary distribution download the proper file in the [release section](https://github.com/umputun/reproxy/releases)
- docker container available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/umputun/reproxy) as well as on [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/users/umputun/packages/container/reproxy/versions). I.e. `docker pull umputun/reproxy` or `docker pull ghcr.io/umputun/reproxy`.

Latest stable version has `:vX.Y.Z` docker tag (with `:latest` alias) and the current master has `:master` tag.

## Providers

Proxy rules supplied by various providers. Currently included - `file`, `docker`, `static` and `consul-catalog`. Each provider may define multiple routing rules for both proxied request and static (assets). User can sets multiple providers at the same time.

_See examples of various providers in [examples](https://github.com/umputun/reproxy/tree/master/examples)_

### Static provider

This is the simplest provider defining all mapping rules directly in the command line (or environment). Multiple rules supported. Each rule is 3 or 4 comma-separated elements `server,sourceurl,destination[,ping-url]`. For example:

- `*,^/api/(.*),https://api.example.com/$1` - proxy all request to any host/server with `/api` prefix to `https://api.example.com`
- `example.com,/foo/bar,https://api.example.com/zzz,https://api.example.com/ping` - proxy all requests to `example.com` and with `/foo/bar` url to `https://api.example.com/zzz` and it sses `https://api.example.com/ping` for the health check.

The last (4th) element defines an optional ping url used for health reporting. I.e.`*,^/api/(.*),https://api.example.com/$1,https://api.example.com/ping`. See [Health check](#ping-and-health-checks) section for more details.

_Pls note: in case if rules set as a part of docker compose environment, destination with the regex group will conflict with compose syntax. I.e. attempt to use `https://api.example.com/$1` in compose environment will fail due to a syntax error. The standard solution here is to "escape" `$` sign by replacing it with `$$`, i.e. `https://api.example.com/$$1`. This substitution supported by docker compose and has nothing to do with reproxy itself. Another way is to use `@` instead of `$` which is supported on reproxy level, i.e. `https://api.example.com/@1`_ 

### File provider

This provider uses yaml file with routing rules.

`reproxy --file.enabled --file.name=config.yml`

Example of `config.yml`:

```yaml
default: # the same as * (catch-all) server
  - { route: "^/api/svc1/(.*)", dest: "http://127.0.0.1:8080/blah1/$1" }
  - {
      route: "/api/svc3/xyz",
      dest: "http://127.0.0.3:8080/blah3/xyz",
      ping: "http://127.0.0.3:8080/ping",
    }
srv.example.com:
  - { route: "^/api/svc2/(.*)", dest: "http://127.0.0.2:8080/blah2/$1/abc" }
  - { route: "^/web/", dest: "/var/www", "assets": true }
```

This is a dynamic provider and file change will be applied automatically.

### Docker provider

Docker provider supports a fully automatic discovery (with `--docker.auto`) with no extra configuration needed.By default it redirects all requests like `http://<container_name>:<container_port>/(.*)` to the internal IP of the given container and the exposed port. Only active (running) containers will be detected.

This default can be changed with labels:

- `reproxy.server` - server (hostname) to match. Also can be a list of comma-separated servers.
- `reproxy.route` - source route (location)
- `reproxy.dest` - destination path. Note: this is not full url, but just the path which will be appended to container's ip:port
- `reproxy.port` - destination port for the discovered container
- `reproxy.ping` - ping path for the destination container.
- `reproxy.assets` - set assets mapping as `web-root:location`, for example `reproxy.assets=/web:/var/www`
- `reproxy.enabled` - enable (`yes`, `true`, `1`) or disable (`no`, `false`, `0`) container from reproxy destinations.

Pls note: without `--docker.auto` the destination container has to have at least one of `reproxy.*` labels to be considered as a potential destination.

With `--docker.auto`, all containers with exposed port will be considered as routing destinations. There are 3 ways to restrict it:

- Exclude some containers explicitly with `--docker.exclude`, i.e. `--docker.exclude=c1 --docker.exclude=c2 ...`
- Allow only a particular docker network with `--docker.network`
- Set the label `reproxy.enabled=false` or `reproxy.enabled=no` or `reproxy.enabled=0`

If no `reproxy.route` defined, the default is `http://<container_name>:<container_port>/(.*)`. In case if all proxied source have the same pattern, for example `/api/(.*)` user can define the common prefix (in this case `/api`) for all container-based routes. This can be done with `--docker.prefix` parameter.

Docker provider also allows to define multiple set of `reproxy.N.something` labels to match multiple distinct routes on the same container. This is useful as in some cases a single container may expose multiple endpoints, for example, public API and some admin API. All the labels above can be used with "N-index", i.e. `reproxy.1.server`, `reproxy.1.port` and so on. N should be in 0 to 9 range.

This is a dynamic provider and any change in container's status will be applied automatically.

### Consul Catalog provider

Use: `reproxy --consul-catalog.enabled`

Consul Catalog provider calls Consul API periodically (every second by default) to obtain services, which has any tag with `reproxy.` prefix. User can redefine check interval with `--consul-catalog.interval` command line flag as well as consul address with `--consul-catalog.address` command line option. The default address is `http://127.0.0.1:8500`. 

For example:
```
reproxy --consul-catalog.enabled --consul-catalog.address=http://192.168.1.100:8500 --consul-catalog.interval=10s  
```

By default, provider sets values for every service:
- enabled `false`
- server `*`
- route `^/(.*)`
- dest `http://<SERVICE_ADDRESS_FROM_CONSUL>/$1`
- ping `http://<SERVICE_ADDRESS_FROM_CONSUL>/ping`

This default can be changed with tags:

- `reproxy.server` - server (hostname) to match. Also, can be a list of comma-separated servers.
- `reproxy.route` - source route (location)
- `reproxy.dest` - destination path. Note: this is not full url, but just the path which will be appended to service's ip:port
- `reproxy.port` - destination port for the discovered service
- `reproxy.ping` - ping path for the destination service.
- `reproxy.enabled` - enable (`yes`, `true`, `1`) or disable (`any different value`) service from reproxy destinations.

## SSL support

SSL mode (by default none) can be set to `auto` (ACME/LE certificates), `static` (existing certificate) or `none`. If `auto` turned on SSL certificate will be issued automatically for all discovered server names. User can override it by setting `--ssl.fqdn` value(s)

## Logging

By default no request log generated. This can be turned on by setting `--logger.enabled`. The log (auto-rotated) has [Apache Combined Log Format](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/logs.html#combined)

User can also turn stdout log on with `--logger.stdout`. It won't affect the file logging above but will output some minimal info about processed requests, something like this:

```
2021/04/16 01:17:25.601 [INFO]  GET - /echo/image.png - xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - 200 (155400) - 371.661251ms
2021/04/16 01:18:18.959 [INFO]  GET - /api/v1/params - xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx - 200 (74) - 1.217669m
```

## Assets Server

Users may turn the assets server on (off by default) to serve static files. As long as `--assets.location` set it treats every non-proxied request under `assets.root` as a request for static files. The assets server can be used without any proxy providers; in this mode, reproxy acts as a simple web server for the static content.

In addition to the common assets server, multiple custom assets servers are supported. Each provider has a different way to define such a static rule, and some providers may not support it at all. For example, multiple asset servers make sense in static (command line provider), file provider, and even useful with docker providers, however it makes very little sense with consul catalog provider.

1. static provider - if source element prefixed by `assets:` it will be treated as file-server. For example `*,assets:/web,/var/www,` will serve all `/web/*` request with a file server on top of `/var/www` directory.
2. file provider - setting optional field `assets: true`
3. docker provider - `reproxy.assets=web-root:location`, i.e. `reproxy.assets=/web:/var/www`.

Assets server supports caching control with the `--assets.cache=<duration>` parameter. `0s` duration (default) turns caching control off. A duration is a sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h" and "d".

There are two ways to set cache duration:

1. A single value for all static assets. This is as simple as `--assets.cache=48h`.
2. Custom duration for different mime types. It should include two parts - the default value and the pairs of mime:duration. In command line this looks like multiple `--assets.cache` options, i.e. `--assets.cache=48h --assets.cache=text/html:24h --assets.cache=image/png:2h`. Environment values should be comma-separated, i.e. `ASSETS_CACHE=48h,text/html:24h,image/png:2h`

## Redirects 

By default reproxy treats destination as a proxy location, i.e. it invokes http call internally and returns response back to the client. However by prefixing destination url with `@code` this behaviour can be changed to a permanent (status code 301) or temporary (status code 302) redirects. I.e. destination set to `@301 https://example.com/something` with cause permanent http redirect to `Location: https://example.com/something`

supported codes:

- `@301`, `@perm` - permanent redirect
- `@302`, `@temp`, `@tmp` - temporary redirect

## More options

- `--gzip`   enables gzip compression for responses.
- `--max=N`  allows to set the maximum size of request (default 64k). Setting it to `0` disables the size check.
- `--header` sets extra header(s) added to each proxied response. 
  
For example this is how it can be done with the docker compose:

```yaml
  environment:
      - HEADER=
          X-Frame-Options:SAMEORIGIN,
          X-XSS-Protection:1; mode=block;,
          Content-Security-Policy:default-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
```

- `--timeout.*` various timeouts for both server and proxy transport. See `timeout` section in [All Application Options](#all-application-options)

## Default ports

In order to eliminate the need to pass custom params/environment, the default `--listen` is dynamic and trying to be reasonable and helpful for the typical cases:

- If anything set by users to `--listen` all the logic below ignored and host:port passed in and used directly.
- If nothing set by users to `--listen` and reproxy runs outside of the docker container, the default is `127.0.0.1:80` for http mode (`ssl.type=none`) and `127.0.0.1:443` for ssl mode (`ssl.type=auto` or `ssl.type=static`).
-  If nothing set by users to `--listen` and reproxy runs inside the docker, the default is `0.0.0.0:8080` for http mode, and `0.0.0.0:8443` for ssl mode.

Another default set in the similar dynamic way is `--ssl.http-port`. For run inside of the docker container it set to `8080` and without to `80`. 

## Ping, health checks and failover

reproxy provides 2 endpoints for this purpose:

- `/ping` responds with `pong` and indicates what reproxy up and running
- `/health` returns `200 OK` status if all destination servers responded to their ping request with `200` or `417 Expectation Failed` if any of servers responded with non-200 code. It also returns json body with details about passed/failed services.

In addition to the endpoints above, reproxy supports optional live health checks. In this case (if enabled), each destination checked for ping response periodically and excluded failed destination routes. It is possible to return multiple identical destinations from the same or various providers, and the only passed picked. If numerous matches were discovered and passed - the final one picked according to `lb-type` strategy (by default random selection).

To turn live health check on, user should set `--health-check.enabled` (or env `HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLED=true`). To customize checking interval `--health-check.interval=` can be used.

## Management API

Optional, can be turned on with `--mgmt.enabled`. Exposes 2 endpoints on `mgmt.listen` (address:port):

- `GET /routes` - list of all discovered routes
- `GET /metrics` - returns prometheus metrics (`http_requests_total`, `response_status` and `http_response_time_seconds`)

_see also [examples/metrics](https://github.com/umputun/reproxy/tree/master/examples/metrics)_

## Errors reporting

Reproxy returns 502 (Bad Gateway) error in case if request doesn't match to any provided routes and assets. In case if some unexpected, internal error happened it returns 500. By default reproxy renders the simplest text version of the error - "Server error". Setting `--error.enabled` turns on the default html error message and with `--error.template` user may set any custom html template file for the error rendering. The template has two vars: `{{.ErrCode}}` and `{{.ErrMessage}}`. For example this template `oh my! {{.ErrCode}} - {{.ErrMessage}}` will be rendered to `oh my! 502 - Bad Gateway`

## Plugins support

The core functionality of reproxy can be extended with external plugins. Each plugin is an independent process/container implementing [rpc server](https://golang.org/pkg/net/rpc/). Plugins registered with reproxy conductor and added to the chain of the middlewares. Each plugin receives request with the original url, headers and all matching route info and responds with the headers and the status code. Any status code >= 400 treated as an error response and terminates flow immediately with the proxy error. There are two types of headers plugins can set:

- `HeadersIn` - incoming headers. Those will be sent to the proxied url
- `HeadersOut` - outgoing headers. Will be sent back to the client 

To simplify the development process all the building blocks provided. It includes `lib.Plugin` handling registration, listening and dispatching calls as well as `lib.Request` and `lib.Response` defining input and output. Plugin's authors should implement concrete handlers satisfying `func(req lib.Request, res *lib.HandlerResponse) (err error)` signature. Each plugin may contain multiple handlers like this.


_See [examples/plugin]() for more info_

## Options

Each option can be provided in two forms: command line or environment key:value pair. Some command line options have a short form, like `-l localhost:8080` and all of them have the long form, i.e `--listen=localhost:8080`. The environment key (name) [listed](#all-application-options) for each option as a suffix, i.e. `[$LISTEN]`.

All size options support unit suffixes, i.e. 10K (or 10k) for kilobytes, 16M (or 16m) for megabytes, 10G (or 10g) for gigabytes. Lack of any suffix (i.e. 1024) means bytes.

Some options are repeatable, in this case user may pass it multiple times with the command line, or comma-separated in env. For example `--ssl.fqdn` is such an option and can be passed as `--ssl.fqdn=a1.example.com --ssl.fqdn=a2.example.com` or as env `SSL_ACME_FQDN=a1.example.com,a2.example.com`

This is the list of all options supporting multiple elements: 

- `ssl.fqdn` (`SSL_ACME_FQDN`)
- `assets.cache` (`ASSETS_CACHE`)
- `docker.exclude` (`DOCKER_EXCLUDE`)
- `static.rule` (`$STATIC_RULES`)

## Status

The project is under active development and may have breaking changes till `v1` is released. However, we are trying our best not to break things unless there is a good reason. As of version 0.4.x, reproxy is considered good enough for real-life usage, and many setups are running it in production.
